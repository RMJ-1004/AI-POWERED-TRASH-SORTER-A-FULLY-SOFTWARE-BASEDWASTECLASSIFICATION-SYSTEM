# 🧠 AI-Powered Trash Sorter 🗑️

A fully software-based waste classification system that uses Artificial Intelligence to automatically identify and sort waste into **biodegradable** and **non-biodegradable** categories through image processing and deep learning.

## 🔍 About the Project

This project addresses the inefficiencies in manual and hardware-based waste segregation methods by offering a **cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable** AI-powered solution. It uses a pre-trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model and computer vision techniques to classify images of trash.

### 🎯 Key Features

- 🧠 AI-based image classification (CNN model)
- 🖼️ User interface for uploading waste images
- 🧪 Visual simulation of virtual waste sorting
- 📊 Classification confidence and analytics display
- ☁️ Lightweight deployment using **Streamlit** or **Flask**
- 🧪 Thoroughly tested: unit, integration, performance, and stress tests

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit / Flask
- **Backend**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy
- **Datasets**: [TACO](https://tacodataset.org/), [TrashNet](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet)
